# Module 01 | Final review | Ana Bollain

## Introduction

This exercise responds to the final review of the first module within Adalab's Web Development Bootcamp. The main goal is to create a Mobile First web application with a responsive design that allows it to adapt to different devices. 

## Requirements

With a Zeplin design as the starter point, the exercise consists on developing a web-site using the following elements:

- Sass
- Flexbox and CSS Grid
- Media queries
- Interactions with the user

The following **requirements** have to be respected:

1. The menu button should have a fixed position and should not dissapear when scrolling. It should also contain a link to Adalab's website.
2. The firs module (Anonymous proxy) should be solved using flexbox, and it needs to occupy the height of the viewport.
3. The second module (Looking Through A Window) should be sholved using the desired CSS properties.
4. The third module (3 Reasons to Purchase) should be laid out using CSS Grid in all screen sizes.
5. The fourth module should be laid out using flexbox and all links should redirect to Adalab's website.

Regarding **interaction** with the user, the following issues have to be resolved:

1. The button from the first module should redirect to the third module.
2. The button from the fourth module should redirect to the beginning of the site.
3. Using :hover in the buttons of "Go" and "3 Reasons to Purchase", a transform property should be used. 
4. A small animation could be implemented in the button from the fourth module. 

## Tools

The project has been developed with **'Adalab Starter Kit'**, a framework created in node and gulp that has pre-installed and pre-configured functionalities. It also contains an HTML template engine, a Sass preprocessor and a local server, among other elements.

The following tools have been used when solving the project:

    - Partials
    - Variables, mixins and functions
